General Info and Prerequisites
==============================

These scripts enables you to measure Scylla's cross DC/region replication latency on Cloud or on-prem deployments.

In this specific code example we are using a single writer in us-east (N. Virginia) to write a single partition using CL=LOCAL_ONE, which we then read from us-west (Oregon) using a single reader.

The write rate is ~5 partitions per second. We calculate the replication latency time on the readerâ€™s end by subtracting the partition's insert time from the partition's now() time at the moment it is read. In both cases it's the server/DB timestamps.


**Prerequisites**
- [python installed](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [pip installed](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/)
- [Multi-DC Scylla cluster on AWS](http://docs.scylladb.com/procedures/ec2_dc/) - Two DCs, one in us-east-1 and the second in us-west-2 (can be different regions/cloud vendor, require a minor change in the scripts)
- An instance in each region for the writer and the reader scripts
- Scylla nodes clock is synced using either ```ntp``` or [chrony](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/)



Instructions
============

1. Install the python drivers on the loaders that will run the scripts
```
$ sudo pip install cassandra-driver
$ sudo pip install time_uuid
```

2. Copy the python scripts to the location from which you will run them

3. Create the following Schema on the Scylla cluster

```
CREATE KEYSPACE replicated WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'us-east': '3', 'us-west-2': '3'}  AND durable_writes = true;

CREATE TABLE replicated.test (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    desired_response_counter int,
    insertion_date timeuuid,
    some_data text
) WITH bloom_filter_fp_chance = 0.01
    AND caching = {'keys': 'ALL', 'rows_per_partition': 'ALL'}
    AND comment = ''
    AND compaction = {'class': 'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'}
    AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'}
    AND crc_check_chance = 1.0
    AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0.1
    AND default_time_to_live = 0
    AND gc_grace_seconds = 864000
    AND max_index_interval = 2048
    AND memtable_flush_period_in_ms = 0
    AND min_index_interval = 128
    AND read_repair_chance = 0.0
    AND speculative_retry = '99.0PERCENTILE';

CREATE TABLE replicated.test_count (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    response_counter counter
) WITH bloom_filter_fp_chance = 0.01
    AND caching = {'keys': 'ALL', 'rows_per_partition': 'ALL'}
    AND comment = ''
    AND compaction = {'class': 'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'}
    AND compression = {'sstable_compression': 'org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.LZ4Compressor'}
    AND crc_check_chance = 1.0
    AND dclocal_read_repair_chance = 0.1
    AND default_time_to_live = 0
    AND gc_grace_seconds = 864000
    AND max_index_interval = 2048
    AND memtable_flush_period_in_ms = 0
    AND min_index_interval = 128
    AND read_repair_chance = 0.0
    AND speculative_retry = '99.0PERCENTILE';
```

4. Run both the writer and reader scripts together as the following:
	- ```python scylla-tester-writer.py [IP from us-east DC] [num of readers]```
	- ```python scylla-tester-reader_log.py [IP from us-west DC] output_file.csv [run duration in min.]```

5. The resutls are logged into a csv file and at the end of the run you will get the ```Max``` and the ```Avg``` latencies output in ms. 
```
Max Latency (ms): 272.00
Avg Latency (ms): 81.46
```
